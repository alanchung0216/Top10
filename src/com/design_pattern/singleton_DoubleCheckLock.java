	/*
	 Without volatile modifier it's possible for another thread in 
	 Java to see half initialized state of instance variable, 
	 but with volatile variable guaranteeing happens-before 
	 relationship, all the write will happen on volatile instance 
	 before any read of instance variable.

	 This was not the case prior to Java 5, and that's why double 
	 checked locking was broken before. Now, with happens-before 
	 guarantee, you can safely assume that this will work.

	// Singleton using Enum in Java
	// Very easy version
	// But I don't see any useful case to take advantage of
	// because if we want to use the object we still need to create
	// the object instance then we will need to use version 3 to
	// handle it.
	
	// This is the way we generally declare Enum Singleton , 
	// it may contain instance variable and instance method but 
	// for sake of simplicity I havenâ€™t used any, just beware that 
	// if you are using any instance method than you need to ensure 
	// thread-safety of that method if at all it affect the state 
	// of object. By default creation of Enum instance is thread safe 
	// but any other method on Enum is programmers responsibility.
	
	// You can acess it by EasySingleton.INSTANCE, much easier than 
	// calling getInstance() method on Singleton.
