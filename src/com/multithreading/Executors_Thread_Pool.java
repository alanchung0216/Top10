/*
In above program, we are creating fixed size thread pool of 5 worker 
threads. Then we are submitting 10 jobs to this pool, since the 
pool size is 5, it will start working on 5 jobs and other jobs will 
be in wait state, as soon as one of the job is finished, another job 
from the wait queue will be picked up by worker thread and get's 
executed.

Here is the output of the above program.

<pre class="prettyprint">
pool-1-thread-2 Start. Command = 1
pool-1-thread-4 Start. Command = 3
pool-1-thread-1 Start. Command = 0
pool-1-thread-3 Start. Command = 2
pool-1-thread-5 Start. Command = 4
pool-1-thread-4 End.
pool-1-thread-5 End.
pool-1-thread-1 End.
pool-1-thread-3 End.
pool-1-thread-3 Start. Command = 8
pool-1-thread-2 End.
pool-1-thread-2 Start. Command = 9
pool-1-thread-1 Start. Command = 7
pool-1-thread-5 Start. Command = 6
